                    <p>Rewilding Europe puts its vision into practice through working in 9 large landscapes across Europe. Based on a screening of over 30 nominations from all over Europe, submitted by a variety of organisations, the first rewilding landscapes became operational by the end of 2011. </p>

                    <p>Within these rewilding landscapes, we have signed a range of agreements with landowners, reserve managers, local communities and individuals that have user rights for management, grazing, hunting, fishing, tourism and others. The number of areas with rewilding agreements has raised from one in 2013 to dozens of agreements now, covering active rewilding measures of more than 50,000 hectares of wetlands, grasslands and forests.</p>

                    <p>For grazing rights, we have established 21 different pilot sites where we work to show the importance of natural grazing. In total, these grazing pilots cover some 15,500 hectares in total, located in 9 different countries. The main species and breeds we work with are European bison, Tauros and various primitive breeds of horse, Asiatic wild ass as well as water buffalo.</p>
